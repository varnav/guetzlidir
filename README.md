# guetzlidir

Will recursively process image files in source directory, optimizing them with Guetzli and writing to output directory.
Processing is slow, memory and CPU intensive.

## Guetzli

[Guetzli](https://github.com/google/guetzli) is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density at high visual quality. Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30% smaller than images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg. Guetzli generates only sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to faster decompression speeds they offer.

## Supported file formats (file extensions):

* JPEG (.jpg .jpeg)
* PNG (.png)

Supports Windows, Linux, MacOS and probably other OSes.

## Installation

```sh
pip install guetzlidir
```

You can download and use it as single Windows binary, see [Releases](https://github.com/varnav/guetzlidir/releases/)

## Usage

### PiPy package

```sh
guetzlidir --minsize 100 --quality 80 /home/username/myphotos /home/username/photos_out
```

### Windows executable

```cmd
./guetzlidir.exe "c:\Users\username\Pictures\My Vacation" "c:\Users\username\Pictures\My Vacation Optimized Pictures"
```
